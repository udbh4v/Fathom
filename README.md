Project Plan & Feasibility Analysis: Project AURA (Automated Geopolitical & Route Analysis for Oil Pricing)

Executive Summary
Project AURA aims to create a predictive analytics platform that forecasts country-specific average oil prices and analyzes their macroeconomic impact. It will achieve this by ingesting and correlating two primary real-time data streams: global oil tanker movements (AIS data) and unstructured news data related to geopolitical events and energy markets.

The core objective is to move beyond simple trend analysis of oil futures (like WTI or Brent) and provide a more granular, causal understanding of price fluctuations based on physical supply chain movements and real-world events. This will provide our trading desks and risk management teams with a significant information advantage.

The project is technically ambitious but feasible. The primary challenge and cost driver will be the acquisition of high-fidelity, real-time maritime data. The plan is structured in phases, starting with a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) using free/low-cost APIs to validate the core logic before scaling with enterprise-grade data sources.
